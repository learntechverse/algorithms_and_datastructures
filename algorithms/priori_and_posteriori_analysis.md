# Priori and Posteriori Analysis

Priori Analysis done while writting the Algorithms and Posteriori Analysis done with teh actual program by running it. Below are some of the key things to call out.

Priori Analysis                                | Posteriori Analysis                                    |

Done with Algorithm      | Done by running the Program (Testing)|
H/W & OS Independent | H/W & OS Dependent |
Language Independent | Language Dependent |
Analyze Complexity with respect to the Time & Space (Donated as Big O Notation) | We will look the time, bytes and cpu its taking to run the program |
