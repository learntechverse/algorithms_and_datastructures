## Algorithm Time & Space Complexities

### Time Complexity

- **Definition**
    1. Time complexity refers to how long it takes for a task to complete based on the amount of work involved and the size of the task.
    2. Time complexity of an algorithm refers to the amount of time it takes to execute and complete its operations as a function of the input size.

- **Everyday Example**: Suppose you're baking cookies, and the recipe requires you to mix ingredients thoroughly. If you have a small batch of ingredients, mixing them together may take just a few seconds (low time complexity). However, if you're baking a large batch, mixing everything might take several minutes (higher time complexity).

#### General Example

- **Task**: Sorting a deck of cards.
  - **Low Time Complexity**: If you have a few cards (e.g., 10 cards), sorting them might take just a few seconds using a simple method like insertion sort (low time complexity).
  - **Higher Time Complexity**: If you have a large deck of cards (e.g., 1000 cards), sorting them using a more complex algorithm like quicksort may take longer due to the increased number of comparisons and swaps (higher time complexity).

### Space Complexity

- **Definition**
    1. Space complexity refers to how much physical space or memory is needed to complete a task based on the size of the task.
    2. Space complexity of an algorithm refers to the amount of memory (space) required by the algorithm to execute as a function of the input size.

- **Everyday Example**: Think about organizing books on a bookshelf. If you have only a few books, you can arrange them neatly on a small shelf (low space complexity). However, if you have a large collection of books, you'll need a bigger shelf or multiple shelves to accommodate all of them (higher space complexity).

#### General Example

- **Task**: Storing a collection of photos on your computer.
  - **Low Space Complexity**: If you have a small number of photos (e.g., 100 photos), storing them on your computer's hard drive might not take up much space (low space complexity).
  - **Higher Space Complexity**: However, if you have a large number of photos (e.g., 10,000 photos), storing them will require more disk space and possibly additional storage solutions like external hard drives or cloud storage (higher space complexity).
